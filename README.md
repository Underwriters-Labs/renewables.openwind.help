Openwind is a wind farm design and optimization software used throughout a wind project’s development to create optimal turbine layouts that maximize energy production, minimize energy losses, account for plant development costs and generate overall project efficiencies.

Our software was developed by drawing on more than 30 years of advisory expertise, which has helped ensure that stakeholders involved in wind project development around the world have confidence in our platform. Additionally, Openwind’s compatibility with other computer wind programs enables you to seamlessly share files and easily migrate existing procedures into our software.
